### 1. Racing
#### Concept
* Cars with BTC, ETH, Paypal, Visa/Mastercard, EOS logo(s) are participating in drag-race. And the max. speed attained is shown in Transactions Per Second (TPS) as a location pop-up after each touches the finish line. The list of max. speed attained is as follows:
	- BTC: 5 TPS
	- ETH: 15 TPS
	- Paypal: 193 TPS
	- Visa/Mastercard: 1000 TPS
	- EOS: 3996 TPS (reached so far with 40% network usage)
* The car's speed shows the time taken in execution of an activity or a transaction. E.g. Here, BTC car is the slowest, which shows person A transferring token to person B is executed in longest time (approx. 1 hr).
